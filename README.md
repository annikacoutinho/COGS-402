Using Network-Based Analyses to Examine the Interpersonal Dynamics of Teamwork in Sport

This repository contains materials for a primer paper that applies Social Relations Modelling (SRM) and Social Network Analysis (SNA) to examine peer-rated teamwork behaviours across multiple sport teams. The analyses decompose interpersonal evaluations into perceiver, target, and dyadic (relationship) components, and explore how these relate to external outcomes such as individual and team performance.

The dataset comes from All Together: A Novel Approach to Understanding the Interpersonal Dynamics of Teamwork in Sport, conducted by the UBC Sport and Performance Psychology Lab.

This repository includes:

- The R Notebook used to conduct analyses and generate figures (HTML format)

- Figures visualizing SRM variance components and network structures

- The processed dataset (CSV format) used for analysis
